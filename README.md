- 👋 Hi, I’m @GiftGiwa
- 👀 I’m currently an undergrad freshman. The only "experience" I have with coding is the AP Comp Sci class I took in high school, and I'm hoping to improve my skills.
- 🌱 Right now, between classes, I learning more about coding in Java through practice, and am hoping to expand to JavaScript and possibly C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, honestly, anything! I hope to bring what I can to the table and improve in the process.
- 📫 You can reach me at my email gdg2131@columbia.edu
